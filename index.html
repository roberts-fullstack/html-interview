Instructions

HTML Interview

Start off by forking this repository. Forking an existing repository is just like creating a new one except that your new repository will contain a copy of the forked code.
Part 1: Ten questions, ten answers

As a group, think of ten total questions that you can ask one another and record the answers to.

Have each person answer the ten questions. Write down both the questions and their answers.
Part 2: Building an HTML page

Now that you have all the questions and answers, its time to display them in HTML.

We'll create a section on the page for each student's answers.

    Start out by creating an empty HTML page with the HTML starter code
    Create 2-3 <div> elements in the <body> section of the HTML, one for each student
    Inside each <div>
        Create a header (either <h1>, <h2>, etc) with the student's name
        Under the header, create an anchor tag that links to the student's GitHub page
        Under the link, add an image of the student
        And finally, create an ordered list that contains a list item for each question and answer
            Each question and answer should be stored in a single list item element (<li>)
